1) First we created an empty repository. inside this repo we created the react projcet using vite with the following command
    npm create vite@latest client
    this is called the client folder which is basically the frontend folder
    Next we installed the tailwind css requirements
2) Now we have the repo on our computer, we want to push it to github. we go to github and create the repository. To push the existing repo 
    on our computer to github from the command line we use
        'git remote add origin githublinkhere'
        'git branch -M main'
        'git push -u origin main'
3) Next we created a pages folder in src in the client side and added all the necessary pages we need for the project
